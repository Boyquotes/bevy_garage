Deep Q learning is a special guest here that knows how to approximate control function.

Possible improvements:

- Current sensors config can't predict good turns, because it can't see behind the wall.
- Computing gradients online is hard, so next improvement from replay buffer is probably offline training longer with bigger batches.

How to run

```sh
cargo prisma generate
cargo run --release
```
